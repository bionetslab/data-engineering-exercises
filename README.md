# data-engineering-exercises

This repository contains study material for the exercises in Data Engineering. 
 > **NOTE**
> Make sure, to read and fully understand the exercise sheet before formulating questions.

The exercise sheets will be publised at least one week in advance so you are able to ask questions about the next exercise sheet in the exercise session. This is our preffered way of answering questions about how to start solving the questions. Otherwise **specific** questions may be answered via e-mail to your tutor whose e-mail adress you obtained in the first exercise session. The more specific your question, the more likely it is that you will be satisfied with the answer.

You can clone this repository to obtain the study material. In general, it will be stated in the exercise sheet if extra study material is required and the folder will be linked explicitly.

 > **NOTE**
 > You are NOT expected to upload your program codes or exercise solutions to this repository (it's read only :) ). The solutions will be discussed in the exercise sessions.
